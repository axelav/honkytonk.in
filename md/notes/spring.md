NASA's Earth Observatory is one of my favorite websites. The editors post daily
satellite imagery from around the world. The photos are typically arresting and
the stories and science describing the imagery is always fascinating.

We've had beatiful weather here in the northeast for the past couple weeks, an
unusual occurrence here for early March. You can almost see what a lovely day it
is down on the Earth's surface in
