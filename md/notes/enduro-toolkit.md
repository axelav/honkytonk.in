With all the snow we've had this winter, I've been so damn bored I cleaned up my
tool pack and wrote down some notes. I mainly use this for trail riding. For a
dual sport/multi-day trip, I'd add a few more tools/spares and throw everything
a backpack.

I've tried a few waist packs and this Zac Speed Matrix is my favorite. It's made
of heavy-duty material, uses large zippers, and keeps its contents dry. The
design is simple: a single, large main compartment with a few mesh organizers
and a clear, quick-access "tail". It comes with a tool roll as well, but it's
pretty bulky. I don't use it. I keep a microfiber cloth in the tail to wipe
goggles and phone/GPS screens. I'll also throw a snack or sandwich in there
while riding.

I stash most stuff in the main compartment:

- tool roll
- hand pump
- tow strap
- 2 oz premix ðŸ’¨ (wrapped in nitrile gloves)
- zip ties, various sizes
- Voile straps (sometimes)

I use a Dirt Bike Gear tool roll. It's perfect. All their gear is great, go buy
it. I only wish they made a fanny pack. I'm sure it'd be perfect as well. I run
tubliss/bibs and do not carry tire irons, tubes, &c. so it's not stuffed. Here's
what's in there:

- KTM axle/spark plug tool (wrapped with duct and electrical tape)
- Knipex 8" pliers wrench ðŸ¤‘
- Leatherman Wingman
- 8, 10, 13 mm wrenches
- small flashlight
- tire plug tools

The small pocket of the tool roll holds:

- Prestacycle ratchet wrench
- 6, 8, 10 mm sockets w/ adapter
- 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 45, 50 Torx bits
- 2, 3, 4, 5 mm hex bits
- Phillips + flat bits
- cutting tool

A few small containers and plastic baggies get stuffed in the mesh pockets on
the fanny pack. These hold spares and (super) basic first aid:

- baggie w/ TP, band aids, ibuprofen, couple o-rings (fit KTM fuel quick
  disconnect, water bladder, other stuff probably...)
- quiksteel
- spare spark plug

**Container (right)**

- 10 amp fuse (2)
- safety wire
- shift lever bolt, washer, and pair of nordlock washers
- small zip ties
- spare master link
- various bolts, washers, etc

**Container (left)**

- tire plugs
- rubber cement
- sandpaper
- patches

I keep a spare shift lever and brake lever ziptied to the frame in the air box.
That's it.
