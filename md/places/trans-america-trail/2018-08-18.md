I left Brooklyn early this morning and camped for the first night at Owens Creek in Catoctin Mountain Park in Maryland. The bike performed beautifully today, probably ran the best it has since I've owned it. It's just got to keep it up.

Roads were mostly pavement, maybe 50 miles of dirt and gravel through state game lands, forests, etc. All was nice riding. I shouldn't try to do 350 miles again, or at least not often. I should also try to get to camp by 6pm or so. I won't be able to keep what I did today up for a month.
