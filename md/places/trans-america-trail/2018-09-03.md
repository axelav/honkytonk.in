It's Labor Day and a rest day for me. I slept in, did some reading, and ate a big breakfast at Kong's Chief Diner. I looked over a few things on the bike, but it stalled a bunch of times riding through the city. Then I laid in bed, watched a bunch of bad movies, and tried not to worry too much about it. Tomorrow I'll take it to the shop.
