Another great day. Hit some fun fast gravel earlier in the day and then lots of backcountry slab. Today I was following sections of the MABDR.

Towards the end of the day as I'm tired and just wanting to roll up to camp, I finally hit some good stuff in George Washington NF. It's been wet around here so it was a bit slippery. There were also four water crossings, though none of them too deep or difficult.

Today was less rushed. I put in what I think will be closer to my average mileage. I sorta stopped for lunch — I just didn't really sit down. I had to zip tie my exhaust shield on — the bolt rattled out. I thought it might melt, but it held up for the day. I cooked up some pasta and tuna for dinner and crashed in the tent.

I had a feeling of being totally alone which I had not had in a very long time. While I was riding, I couldn't place the last time I felt it, bit thinking back now I remember the trip I took with Brendan that I felt that way. I miss Em, our dog Cooper, our life in NYC. But the thing that makes missing them ok is knowing that I'll be back home to them. It's just gonna be a while.

Tomorrow I'll join up with the TAT proper in Virginia.
