I had little confidence in the bike this morning, and decided to skip the New Mexico sections of the TAT. I'm unhappy about that, but saw little sense in getting too far from civilization before making the bike right. Colorado Springs had a KTM shop, wasn't too far off course, and would be a decent place to spend a rest day, so I pointed my front wheel north.

Once I got to Trinidad, CO, I was restless and with the bike running well when given gas, I decided I was comfortable with whatever happened, so I joined back with the trail and rode to La Veta. It was gorgeous, with mountains on the horizon, and great dirt roads through forested canyons. Even with the bike issues, I was super exicted to be here.

From there I rode into Colorado Springs and splurged on a hotel. I'm having a rest day tomorrow and will be going over a couple things on the bike. If I can't figure it out, I'll limp it to the shop after Labor Day.
