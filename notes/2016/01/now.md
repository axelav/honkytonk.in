I'm currently living in Brooklyn, trying to focus on:

- family & dogs
- learning (link to /learning) ??? should I start a pinboard tag called learning
  or somehow do this so its things I actually learned?
  things on pinboard that I blockquote?

// FIXME
- mediation
- self-employment
- craftsmanship

distracted & enriched by:

- motorcycles
- hiking
- the stupid internet
- books (link to /books)
- music (link to /music)

// FIXME
- drinking
- running
- writing
