I've been out in the Rockaways the past couple days & just want to get a few
notes down. I've been working with [Occupy Sandy](http://occupysandy.com), or
sometimes just walking down blocks & asking if people need help (pretty much
everyone does). we've demoed basements & hauled warped furniture, sopping
clothes, ruined cassette tapes, & rusted weight benches &mdash; the detritus
that piles up over the course of a life &mdash; out to the curb.

the boardwalk is gone & chunks of it litter the streets, which lay under a layer
of sand. military vehicles & helicopters constantly hum around the pennisula.
cars ended up in places they could never have been parked. someone scrawled
"FUCK SANDY" on a basement wall & another resident wrote a note on a handball
wall:

> 1 - WHERE IS OUR HOSPITAL?<br> 2 - JOHN CORI WARNED YOU! DEMAND THE SAND.
> SHAME ON YOU!!<br> 3 - GO XXXXX OR NO USA

[John Cori][link], who began Friends of Rockaway Beach, organized rallies over
the past few years to draw attention to the eroding beach & aging boardwalk.
looking around now, it seems that he may have been right. but what is the word
that got crossed out?

it's been depressing & completely exhausting, but I've also met amazing &
generous people each day. the area will be rebuilt, but for the time being,
everyone is just trying to make it to tomorrow.

a big thank you goes out to Occupy Sandy, whose thousands of volunteers have
done a superb job of filling in the major gaps that government & charity orgs
have missed &mdash; mostly getting volunteers into areas & homes that need
immediate assistance.

I know thousands of images of the area have already been published, but here are
a few I took around Beach 108th Street on Monday & Beach 92nd Street on
Tuesday.
