TODO what to do with this???

# First Thought

## How To

1.  Sit properly: back straight, shoulders & belly relaxed, feet planted, hands
    with plams down just below knees, chin tucked, jaw relaxed, tongue on roof of
    mouth; eyes open, gaze soft & six feet ahead
2.  Breathe: in & out
3.  Keep your attention on your breath: if thoughts come, let them go; always come
    back to your breath; let thoughts touch you & leave; you are like the sky

- make offerings (incense, candle, flower, => offer yourself)
- request blessings (keep simple, accept what is given)
- dedicate the merit (your practice is only for the benefits of others)
