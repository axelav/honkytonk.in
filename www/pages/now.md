### Now

I'm Axel. This is my dumb website that I made while living in Brooklyn, NY. I'm married to an exceptional woman, and we have a really [great dog](https://s3.amazonaws.com/honkytonk.in/IMG_1439.jpg). I like to [read](/library). I am constantly distracted and enriched by [motorcycles](https://github.com/axelav/motorcycles). I try to be a decent human and continue learning. I used to hike a lot, but now I mostly ride dirt bikes. I try to find new ways to enjoy this stupid internet thing we're all living on, but it gets harder all the time.

Send me an email at [axel@ftml.net](mailto:axel@ftml.net).
