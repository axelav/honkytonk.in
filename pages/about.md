# About

I'm Axel. This is my dumb website. I live in Brooklyn but am trying to escape like everyone else. I am married to an exceptional woman & we have a really great dog. I like to [read](/library). I really like [motorcycles](https://gitlab.com/axelav/motorcycles). I try to mediate every day, be a decent human, and keep [learning](/learned). I used to hike a lot but haven't gotten out as much lately. I try to find new ways to love this stupid internet thing we're all living on, but it gets harder all the time.

Look at all of the bad code I write on [GitHub](https://github.com/axelav). Stalk all the dumb things I'm looking at on the stupid internet on [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:axelav). Listen to all of the horrible records I buy on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/axelav/collection) and [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/rkdwp).

Send me an email at [axel@ftml.net](mailto:axel@ftml.net).
