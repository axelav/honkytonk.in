In 2019, I rode a few different styles of off-road races: enduro, hare
scramble, and stage rally. While the rally was the most fun, there just aren't
many of them happening (at least on the east coast), they're usually far away,
and they're expensive. Hare scrambles are fun too but you race laps, so while
the track deteriorates over the race, it's still mostly the same each lap.

Enduro is where I really enjoyed myself. There's plenty of intensity like in a
hare scramble, but you don't have as many riders flying by you. The tracks are
usually very challenging, so every ride is going to push you and make you
improve on the bike, but it's also fun, for a certain type of person hahah. The
timekeeping aspect is kind of fun and keeps you on your toes during transits.

Learning how it all works has been an enjoyable process while off the bike at
home. Though I've now purchased an ICO CheckMate+ computer and won't have to put
as much effort into preparing, it will still be a good idea to review the
confirmation sheets and try to learn a bit about the track before riding it. In
2020, I'd like to ride a minimum of 10 ECEA enduros. It will be a lot of racing,
but I think it's doable. Racing will just be my main riding that I do next
season.

#### Broad Mountain Enduro

I rode the Broad Mountain Enduro on May 26, 2019. It was my first enduro and
it really kicked my ass! I had no idea how difficult it would actually be,
especially as I've had very little experience riding the type of terrain it
covered &mdash; rocky and rooty, muddy and slippery, steep ascent and
descents. I was terrified for the first few miles and then just exhausted. I
did not finish, and I learned how much better shape I need to be in before I
give a go at another one.
