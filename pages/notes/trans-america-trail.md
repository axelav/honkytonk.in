This past August and September, I travelled across the country on the Trans America Trail on my 2010 KTM 690 Enduro R. I made a [little website](https://tat.honkytonk.in) with my ride report and photos from each day. Here are some overall stats:

- 30 days
- 7500 miles
- three rear and two front tires
- two oil changes
- one failed fuel filter and one failed fuel pump
