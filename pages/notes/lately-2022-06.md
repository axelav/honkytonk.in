I'm trying to make writing these a habit but so far it has not stuck. For most of June, I was thinking about July and the two months of racing that will kick off then. Anyway, here's some stuff that happened this month and things I enjoyed.

Emily moved back from Ithaca, and Cooper came back from his stay up there. I am happy to have them both home.

I bought my first trials bike, a 2020 Gas Gas TXT 300. I can't wait to get out on it.

#### Enduro

The [ECEA](https://ecea.org/ecea/) season picked back up again with the Ridge Run sprint enduro. I didn't ride as well as I'd have liked and finished in 9th B Vet / 29th Overall B.

I got out on the enduro bike every weekend though, and I bicycled ~345 miles. I'm trying to keep to a focused strength training routine too. My fitness feels good going into all the races coming up, though I'm sure I'll find my endurance lacking at the hard enduros.
