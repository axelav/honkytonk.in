> Transits of Venus are among the rarest of predictable astronomical phenomena.
> They occur in a pattern that generally repeats every 243 years, with pairs of
> transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5
> years. The periodicity is a reflection of the fact that the orbital periods of
> Earth and Venus are close to 8:13 and 243:395 commensurabilities.
>
> The last transit of Venus was on 5 and 6 June 2012, and was the last Venus
> transit of the 21st century; the prior transit took place on 8 June 2004. The
> previous pair of transits were in December 1874 and December 1882. The next
> transits of Venus will be on 10â€“11 December 2117, and 8 December 2125.
