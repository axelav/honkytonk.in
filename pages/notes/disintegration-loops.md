_The Quietus_ recently published a great [interview][0] with William Basinski on
the tenth anniversary of the Disintegration Loops. He speaks at length about how
the music came to be & what meaning he finds in the decaying loops:

> The main theme of it to me was...the most profound thing to me immediately was
> the redemptive nature of what had just transpired; the fact that the life and
> death of each of these melodies was captured in another medium and remembered.
> So that was really the main thought, not so much the mortality.

As well as how the significance of 9/11 affected the music:

> I had this massive sound system in there. It was massive and all the windows
> were open. So I just put the Disintegration Loops on while everyone was
> staring at what was going on. While we tried to work out what the hell was
> going on... All of a sudden the world had changed. It had taken on new
> meaning. As the days and months went by, people just cascaded into their own
> disintegration loops of fear, terror and anxiety. But also there was a
> rethinking going on about what had value. There was a lot of compassion in the
> public sphere amongst New Yorkers... I decided to release the records as an
> elegy. I would release them myself one at a time because I couldnâ€™t afford to
> produce a box set and no one knew who I was anyway. It would have been too
> much but I felt that each one had plenty of music on it.

It happened over 10 years ago but I can't watch this without welling up.
