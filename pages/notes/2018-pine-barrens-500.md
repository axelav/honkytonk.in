# 2018 Pine Barrens 500

TODO add photos

## Friday

I woke at 5am, loaded the bike, and got on the road by six. The thermometer read around 40&deg; F. It was a cold two hours over the Verraznano Bride and then south on the NJ Turnpike and 206 to Hammonton. I made it by 8:30 and got registered and the bike inspected.

I rode great with a guy whose name I can't remember. He rode his Husky 501 very well, especially in the enduro sections. He'd really get ahead of me there, but I could keep up with him in the sand and through the woods roads. The tracks were really fun with a good dose of all the terrain the Pine Barrens offers. Jack ends the day with a long run through a deep sand section where he then turns you back around to run right through it. I remember being exhausted going through it last year but feeling great today.

## Saturday

It was absolutely soaking this morning after pouring rain all night. In hindsight, I should've skipped the day. The morning started off well, and I made my way through slower groups. Eventually I caught up with a group of three guys and rode behind them. (When we ended up stopping, we realized we had met last year as well.) As we got close to the lunch stop, the puddles got super deep. Some were being filled by overflowing wetlands to the side of the road. I sucked in a small bit of water going through a deep one. Pulled the plug, turned over the engine a few times, and everything seemed good. A few miles later we came on another really deep puddle. I went through last after the other guys had dug it up, got stuck, and when I went to put my foot down fell over to my left, dropping the bike in the water! Fuck! We pulled it out, pulled the plug again, etc. It started back up, but this time water shot out of the exhaust as well. There was a gas station a few miles up. I decided to ride there and then call the support truck. It ran rough by the time we got there.

The truck picked me up, and I spent the afternoon riding around with Dennis. He knew a lot about the forests and pointed things out and told stories as we drove around. There wasn't a lot more action that afternoon. Most people had smartly called the day early and gone back to the motel.

We stopped by NAPA where I bought eight quarts of 10w40 and proceeded to change the oil four times before it looked pretty clean. I let the bike run for 10 minutes with no problems and would decide what to do tomorrow morning.

## Sunday

The forest was still soaking this morning.
one deep puddle, probably got the starter solenoid

## Notes

- leave home at 5:30am on Friday morning!

## Sand Blast Rally consideration

If you do well at this year's PB500 (finish every day? You should be able to do this!) then perhaps you should sign up for the 2019 Sand Blast Rally? You'd have to learn a decent amount but it would be fun. Figure out what it would cost (truck rental, licenses & entry fees, bike parts, etc).
