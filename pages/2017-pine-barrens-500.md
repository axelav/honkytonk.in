# 2017 PB 500

## story

The trails rattled the screws that hold my pen together & twist off seal from a
bottle of Cleareyes.

I broke my hand which required surgery and my lower leg which my Russian doctor
assured me required nothing. He was right.

Chain breaking after a guy rode his Africa Twin over me.

The rain on Sunday and the crash.
