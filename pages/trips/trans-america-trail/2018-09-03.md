It's Labor Day and a rest day for me. Slept in, did some reading, and got a big breakfast at Kong's Chief Diner in Colorado Springs this morning. Tried the position reset again cuz why not but the bike stalled a bunch of times riding through the city. Then I laid in bed and watched a bunch of bad movies. Tried not to worry too much about the bike today and just relax. Tomorrow I'll take it to the shop.
