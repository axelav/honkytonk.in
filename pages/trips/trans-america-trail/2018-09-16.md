I started off my final morning on the TAT heading through Umpqua National Forest and Wild Rouge Wilderness. A couple more sections were closed due to fire, so I had to reroute around via paved roads.

Navigation was a bit tricky today today, and I made a lot of wrong turns, following trails that would eventually be overgrown or blocked by downed trees. The GPS wasnâ€™t really helping as the tracks seemingly ran between two roads on the map. I worked my way in their general direction and it would eventually work out.

Around noon, I came over a summit to much taller pines and an abundance of ground foliage. It was damp everywhere with fungal growth covering sections of the road. The scent on the pines and damp air was incredible. The mountains were exquisite. I was getting close to the coast. A small sign along the road indicated as much.

The fog thickened and rain got heavier in Siskiyou National Forest. The roads were pretty good if somewhat rocky, but visibility was very poor. I had to sit cuz standing made me lose a few feet of visibility of the road ahead. At one point, I looked off to my left at an overlook. When I turned back, I found myself at decent speed in a foot deep rut with a large rock ahead of me. I somehow dodged the rock and made my way out of the rut. I don't think I'd have gotten so lucky if I'd tried to do it again. Eyes on the road.

As I came off the last stretch of dirt road, I stopped and gave thanks to the dirt gods for their blessings. I soon found myself on the beach at Battle Rock, looking out over the Pacific Ocean. My TAT ride was complete.

I stopped for lunch and then got back on the bike. I had done about 140 miles but now had another 250 more to get outside of Portland, where I would be shipping the bike from tomorrow. I headed north, following 101 up the coast. I came through Coos Bay and saw the Oregon Dunes to my left, which are wild and looked like they'd be tons of fun to ride.

After passing through Florence, the 101 runs right along the coast and is very scenic. I caught the sunset at Seal Rock, and then it started to get chilly. By the time I got to Lincoln City and cut back east towards Portland, it was pitch black, and I was thankful for the Baja Designs headlight I'd installed. It was a cold, tense ride to Tualatin but without issue.

I was done.
