While I was chatting with Scott over coffee this morning, I mentioned I needed to get new tires in Moab. He asked me what I was looking for and said he had a D606 rear and suggested a Shinko 216 MX that he'd been liking more than the MT21. I deferred to his judgment and he mounted them up for me. I gave K a little rinse and headed out.

Don't skip 3 Step Hideaway! Scott and Julie were awesome hosts even though I was the only one staying for one night. I'll be back for sure.

The tracks were flat and fast to La Sal where I then started climbing again toward Geyser Pass. Sam threw me through about a mile of really rough stuff but the riding was mostly nice and the landscape similar to Colorado. Shortly after the pass though, it all changed and there was no doubting I was in Utah. Rock formations, sandstone, and long canyons continued for miles. The track followed a canyon rim and entered the Sand Flats. The roads where looser and I was glad to have fresh tires, particularly the rear. I never felt totally confident with the TKC80 but the new D606 hooked up nicely. The riding was easy and scenic the rest of the way into Moab.

I found a secluded spot with some shade at Drinks Canyon to throw the tent down and rested for a bit. I needed to head back into Moab to see if I could find some brake pads. While changing the tires earlier we noticed that there was little left of the rear. I'm guessing I did a number on them going over the passes yesterday. Mad Bro Motorsports had some so I picked them up and grabbed a late lunch. Then back to the campsite for the evening. Tomorrow I'm planning to ride White Rim Trail.
