K had a layer of frost this morning when I went to start her up. It was chilly, but the sun would quickly warm everything up. From La Pine to Crescent the roads were sandy, and they reminded me of southern New Jersey but with taller pines. Nothing got too deep or sketchy, and the morning passed pleasurably.

The trail headed through the Oregon Cascades and into Umpqua National Forest which had some fun, fast windy sections. Up along Rhododendron Ridge, lots of fire damage was visible and the air was thick with smoke.

After hitting Forest Road 29, the section leading to Tiller was closed due to fire, so it was in to town on the twisty road that followed Jackson Creek.

I was expecting fuel in Tiller but found that the entire town had been bought up a year or two ago. A guy waiting at the ranger station mentioned this to me, and we chatted for a while. He said there was a station at Days Creek, but they closed early on Sunday, which they had by the time I arrived. So I rode to Canyonville for gas and then took the interstate a few miles to Azalea. I really wish Sam would update his maps more frequently with this type of information. Had I filled up in Crescent, I would have been able to make it without the detour.

I got back on the TAT at Azalea, and it followed a nice county road. At Glendale, I punched in Wolf Creek Inn to Google Maps, and it sent me on deeply rutted dirt road into town. About half a mile from town, there were huge pits in the road that were easy enough to get around on a bike but good luck if you try taking four wheels over that road. It was the roughest riding I hit all day. Thanks Google.

I had dinner at the inn and got to sleep early. I should be in Port Orford around lunchtime tomorrow.
