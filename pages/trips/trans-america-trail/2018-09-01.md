Mostly on pavement today, trying to get the hell out of Oklahoma. Got in some good miles in the red dirt this morning though.

The bike stalled around 4pm as I was stopped at a light in Boise City. Started right back up but felt a bit rough at idle. Then it happened again. Ran great with throttle but stalled with no input. I got to LJs Bunkhouse and pulled off the seat. I swapped in my spare fuel injector and a new oiled air filter, which I was meaning to around this time in the trip. No better. I let it sit for a couple hours this evening and tried to start it. It idled for a few seconds and then cut out. Fuck. I'm too exhausted to do more research tonight and the WiFi is bad here. Guess I'll see what happens in the morning.

Things to try

- Tighten throttle cables
- Look at EFI for dummies thread
