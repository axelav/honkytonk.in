Picked up a couple liters of oil from Renegade Sports in Logan and headed to the TAT. The morning started off easily enough, riding through flat farmland on dirt and gravel. The TAT runs north from Tremonton through Pocatello Valley, skirts just east of the Curlew National Grassland, and then continues through Arbon Valley. Throughout the morning, a heavy haze hung in the valleys, obscuring the mountains to the east and west.

After lunch in American Falls, the route follows a rough dirt road into Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve for some excellent riding. The road started out with lots of deep ruts but soon smoothed out and became super fun, twisty two track. Small open rift cracks appeared at the roadside and weird hills poked up far off on the horizon. A sign indicated that this section passes over the Great Rift of Idaho, though I couldn't see much of anything where it did. Roads for numerous mines and, more rarely, wells wound and disappeared into the endless grassland. The air was still very hazy, and Big Southern Butte was barely visible to the north. It was a good 60 or so miles without seeing much of anything, but I enjoyed it greatly. One of my favorite sections of the TAT.

At the gas station in Arco, Peter (aka Motopet on here) rode up while I was fueling. He had finished his TAT ride about a week ago and was on his way home. We decided to find a camping spot together and trade stories. He also had a few tips for me along the route through Idaho and Oregon.
