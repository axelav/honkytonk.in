### Life Back Home (October 6, 2018)

#### _7479 miles round trip_

26112 - 18633

“How early is too early to plan the next trip?”

Having a hard time explaining the significance of the trip to people.

How did it change me? More self reliance, greater desire to push myself further physically and mentally.

I’d do the trip again or something like it but also think I’d like to do it with another person.

I believe my riding skills increased tremendously. I don’t hesitate at unfamiliar terrain and am able to read it much more. I know the bikes quirks and capabilities so much more, as well as my own and what I can coax from the machine.

Heavier springs helped hugely. Steering damper was very handy in certain situations.
