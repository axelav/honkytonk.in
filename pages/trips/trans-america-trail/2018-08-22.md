I was up early to catch the sunrise, but as soon as I got on the road, things went downhill. The side stand spring bolt broke. It's completely stripped. This is gonna be a real pain, I can tell. I was leaning the bike against trees and gas pumps all day long.

I had to skip some dirt sections cuz I needed to be in Townsend by late afternoon and then the Smoky Mountain Heintooga Ridge Road was closed, which was a bummer. I dipped around the gate but about five miles in I was not-so-kindly turned back by a parks employee on a gigantic mower. Fair enough. It rained some more today, but I think the weather should turn in the next day or so. I made it to Townsend and met my dad. He's rented a bike, and we're going to roll around the Smokies for the next two days.

K rolled over 20k clicks today too! Side stand or not, still running very strong.
