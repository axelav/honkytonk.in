Left Batesville heading north to pick up 10W60 at Graham KTM in Senatobia MI. I asked them to mount the new rear tire and I rinsed some of the dust off the bike. Donny & Jake there were super helpful & very welcoming of TAT riders. They dropped everything and helped me on the spot. I was back on the road by 9:30, riding the levees and then over the Mississippi. Another sunny morning. I'm gonna miss Mississippi, friendly people and great riding.

Arkansas starts with a couple miles of pavement and then the gravel starts and goes and goes. I stopped into the TAT Stop a little after noon, had a drink and shot the shit with Percy, who was betting on horses, and Al. I signed in and got back at it. More gravel, more dust. A couple reroutes for mud holes and road work. Some of it was fun, some required more attention, but you could cruise at a good speed at least. I was also thankful for the steering damper.

Near Beebe the skies got dark so I stopped at gas station to rest. Decided I'd had enough of the gravel for the day and took the state highways up to Clinton to stay for the night. The sun was setting and mist hung in the valleys. It was gorgeous and got me excited for tomorrow's riding through Ozark NF.

I had planned to do the oil this evening but a long day and late arrival made me change my mind. I'll do it in the morning.
