~~It got really hot, really quickly today. No surprise I guess, but it took a lot out of me.~~

I headed out to White Rim Road via the Mineral Bottom entrance. Mineral Bottom Road is a fun, fast dirt road with fantastic scenery and views of the surrounding canyon country. Just before the rim trail begins, a series of sharp switchbacks drops you down into a canyon. The road got rougher with lots a variation between rock, hard dirt, and soft sand with steep vertical cliffs off to the side. After following the path of the Green River for a while, the track cuts away from the water and over Hardscrabble Hill. It's a good workout with a sandy ascent from the north and a steep, rocky descent on the south side. Things flattened out again and continued along the river.

About 20 miles in, I stopped to talk to a ranger who mentioned that he rides dual sports as well and that the Parks Service gives them a KTM 350 to patrol the trail. Not a bad gig!

He drove off, and I went to get back on the bike when I noticed the extra few liters of water I was carrying was hanging off to the side and my spare tubes were gone. Without the rest of my luggage on, I'd gotten lazy about securing everything properly, and it had gotten seriously jostled over the course of the day. I felt I should go back for them, figuring they most likely bounced off around Hardscrabble. Eight or so miles back I found them sitting in a rut. At this point it was hot as hell, and I felt a bit fatigued from not eating a decent breakfast. So with some regret, I headed back the way I came, though it was even more fun as I was familiar with the terrain. I'll be back in Moab to complete the trail another day.

As I came back over Hardscrabble, I dropped the bike in a sand hole coming back down the sandy north side. I knew it would happen as soon as I saw the hole. Probably willed it into happening. The ground was very soft, so no worries. Got back on the bike and returned to Moab for lunch at Milt's Stop & Eat. Great burgers and shakes.

The heat continued to increase, so I stopped for an iced coffee and to figure out where I was headed tomorrow. A guy working in the cafe's kitchen came over, asked where I was riding, and mentioned that taking the Utah BDR would bring me up in higher elevation and cooler temperatures. I could rejoin the TAT south of the Idaho border. I'd read of other TAT riders doing this, and he vouched that the riding was good. The ranger I spoke with earlier had said the same, so I'm weighing my options. It doesn't look like it's going to get cooler soon on the path the TAT takes. When I reach Green River tomorrow I'll decide whether to continue west or head north.

I spent the remainder of the afternoon cruising up UT-128 along the Colorado, stopping to enjoy the way the sun's light changed the canyons as it set and then headed back to camp.

I finished reading To Dakar and Back by Lawrence Hacking this evening. If you're interested in rally racing or endurance motorcycling in any way, it's a great account of the 2001 Paris-Dakar by a privateer. And while I'm certainly not racing, there are some similarities in how Hacking describes dealing with long days in the saddle, unfamiliar terrain, mechanical issues on the trail, etc.
