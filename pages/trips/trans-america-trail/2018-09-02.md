I'm off the TAT in Colorado Springs. The bike still stalls in idle but runs strong as hell otherwise. I have a feeling something with the throttle sensors is out of spec.

I skipped all of the New Mexico sections of the TAT. I'm pretty unhappy about that but I had very little confidence in the bike this morning and it was not a good feeling.

Once I got to Trinidad, CO I was restless and since the bike ran well with throttle, I decided I was comfortable with whatever happened, so I joined back with the TAT and rode to La Veta. It was gorgeous, mountains on the horizon, great dirt roads, forested canyons.

From there I decided to split off to Colorado Springs and splurged on a hotel. I'm having a rest day tomorrow. Going to over a couple things on the bike and try to figure out how I can get it hooked up to a diagnostic system to do the throttle checks. Since it's Labor Day that will most likely not happen until Tuesday.

- Valves
- Fuel filter
- Throttle body sensor
- Plastic gear on throttle body worn?
