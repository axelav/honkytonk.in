### Tennessee & Mississippi

> The first 81 miles of the TAT from Andrews to Tellico Plains is quite nice and at one point you end up crossing over the Cherohala. Don't give up on TN and MS. Each state is different and has it's own charm and fun. Unless it's really wet - then I'd be looking for short cuts in MS. Eastern AR is kinda flat but with a few interesting bits but riding that you're on your way to the Ozarks which are not to be missed. The only place I'd skip, and I'd do it every time, is just about all of the dirt west of Tulsa in OK and jump back on the TAT in Boise City OK.

### Arkansas

#### Lodging

- [Byrds Adventure Center][7]
- [TAT Shak][8]

### Oklahoma

> Personally I would suggest riding the TAT route as far as Ponca City (with any detour for flooding of course), then slab it to Alva and ride the scenic section west to where it crosses hwy 64 again, then make up some time on the pavement again, either via Liberal (Kanasas) if you need an overnight, and pick up the TAT again at Boise City before New Mexico.

> [source][30]

#### Lodging

- [Great Plains Bunk House][11] (might be able to do maintenance & ship tires/oil/etc here)

### Colorado

- [pass statuses][12]
- [video about various passes & routes][13]
- [Tin Cup Pass][14]
- [Tomichi Pass][15]
- [Hancock Pass][16]
- Alpine Loop
- Animas Forks, ghost town
- Taylor Park, "You could spend many days there roaming"
- [St. Elmo, Hancock & Tomichi passes][17]
- [info about distances between passes & genenal Colorado pass stuff][26]

> When you guys are providing info about blocked passes. you should give some context. Anyone following either of the popular tracks will not be going through most of the Alpine loop. Tin Cup, Tomichi, and Hancock aren't on the plan either. You leave Salida and go down over Marshal Pass, over to Lake City then Cinnamon Pass and then you're pretty much done with higher elevations in Colorado. I'm going to guess that Marshal and Cinnamon open up earlier than some of the others. So just because some passes are still blocked in early July doesn't mean I wouldn't launch to be there about that time.

#### Lodging

- [Raven's Rest Hostel - Lake City][27]
- [Taylor Park Trading Post][50] a bit north off the TAT but looks to be a lot of good riding in the area

### Utah

- White Rim Road, [day-use permit required][52] from [NPS][18]; [start early, go clockwise][19] to avoid staring into the sun all day.
- shit tons of Moab GPS routes in basecamp
- Black Dragon Canyon
- Shaffer Trail in Canyonlands N.P.
- Pritchet Canyon (difficult)
- Sovereign Trail (difficult)

#### Lodging

- [3 Step Hideaway][20]
- reservation at Colorado River site?

### Oregon

- [ride on beach][48]: Cape Kiwanda, Gearhart to Warrenton (~10 mi stretch)

#### Lodging

- [coastal camping info][49]
