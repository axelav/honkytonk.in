Did the oil this morning at a Walmart parking lot. All went smoothly. It had rained overnight & the woman at the motel said I should prepare for mud. I hoped she was wrong and she was. It was misty as I got up into the hills and the riding was much better than yesterday. Really wide nicely graded gravel, fun switchbacks and climbs, miles of good fun. The sun came out after an hour or so and burned off the mist.

Lunch and gas at the Oark Cafe. They do a pretty perfect burger and pie. I stopped a few miles before I reached it to check where I was at and swear I could smell the scent of pies baking in the air.

Roads got a bit tighter, with more single lane dirt heading up White Rock Mountain where there is a spectacular view of the Ozarks. Not too long after that I made a right onto Warloop Road and knew I was in for some fun. It's probably the most technical section of the TAT so far but I slipped the clutch, picked my lines, and got through with no issues. I tried to get a good photo but it's hard to capture how steep and rocky it is. At some points you're basically riding down a set of rock stairs. I wouldn't want to go back the other way, even if I was Graham Jarvis.

The winds picked up and skies darkened around 5pm but the rain mostly skirted around my path. I rode the farm roads out of Arkansas and into Oklahoma to Tahlequah where I'm stopped for the night.

I'm not liking the TKC80 as much as the D606. It seems a little more slippery around the corners but it'll work.
