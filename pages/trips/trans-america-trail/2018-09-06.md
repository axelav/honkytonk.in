What a morning! Finally got some sunshine as I started out to Cinnamon Pass. Heavy fog hung in the canyon the road followed and over San Cristobal Lake.

I hit Cinnamon, California, and Corkscrew pass in short order. They were pretty wild. The riding wasn't too difficult but it was very slow going. Corkscrew has a very steep descent over a road a large rocks. I boiled my rear brake fluid just as I was getting to the end of the steepest sections. Could've been bad a moment or two before.

It took close to four hours to do the 50 miles over the passes, and I stopped in Silverton for lunch while a strong rain and hail storm came through. Bought some overpriced waterproof gloves from the Harley store there. They're a little too small but far warmer than the gloves I have. They helped warm my hands up for a bit and they'll most likely see some more use when it gets colder again.

After lunch I hit Ophir which felt tame after the last few passes. It looked like bad weather westward again. The trail took me through vast alpine forest and aspen groves through Lizard Head Wilderness before dropping down to the farmland of western Colorado. There were bad storms to the south but I managed to skirt around them.

From Dove Creek, I hightailed it on the dirt roads into Utah and over to 3 Step Hideaway where Scott had a steak and corn on the cob waiting for me. We chatted for an hour or so and then I crashed under a million stars.
