The morning started on fun, straight dirt roads and then followed the old highway into Green River. I joined the Utah BDR there and headed north. The road quickly deteriorated into sandy washes, deep ruts, and rocky steps.

At some points the road was completely washed out, and I followed tracks around through the brush. It was really slow going and after 10:30 the heat made it hard to stop for more than a few seconds in the sun. I rested in the small areas of shade I could find to cool down myself and the bike. The slow speeds and heat were overheating us both. I didn't take any photos of the roads here cuz I didn't want to stop at all, but I wish I had. It was the toughest riding Iâ€™ve had to do the entire trip.

After a few hours, I hit a better road and got to enjoy the scenery. I fueled up in Wellington and the route led up through Ninemile Canyon on a paved, twisty road. It then cut back west on a fun dirt road through Ashley National Forest and Azure Canyon. Lots of ranches provided more cattle and horse traffic. The horses quickly move out of the way, but cows seem to jump in the opposite direction you think they might go.

I was in need of a shower after a few days outside in the heat, so I slabbed to Duchesne for a room.

Today felt like the most remote riding I've done. I'm sure being surrounded by the hyperactive scene in Moab the past few days only increased that feeling, but throughout the morning I didn't see a single person or even a truck.
