I find this to be one of the most beautiful songs I've ever come across. I'd
probably have to credit Rachel's for introducing me to what's called "modern
classical", which now takes a large segment of my listening time. This is one of
(the only?) Rachel's songs with vocals & it's a heartbreaker. This recording is
particularly wrenching as it comes shortly after the death of Rachel's founding
member Jason Noble.
